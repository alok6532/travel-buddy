## 📱 Technical Implementation Notes

### Navigation
```javascript

const [currentScreen, setCurrentScreen] = useState(0);
const totalScreens = 8;

const nextScreen = () => {
  if (currentScreen < totalScreens - 1) {
    setCurrentScreen(currentScreen + 1);
    // Track analytics: screen_viewed, screen_number
  }
};

const skipOnboarding = () => {
  // Save: onboarding_completed = true
  // Navigate to main app
};
```

### Progress Dots
```javascript
const ProgressDots = ({ current, total }) => (
  <View style={styles.dotsContainer}>
    {[...Array(total)].map((_, i) => (
      <View
        key={i}
        style={[
          styles.dot,
          i === current && styles.dotActive
        ]}
      />
    ))}
  </View>
);
```

### Screen Transitions
```javascript
// Framer Motion (React Web)
<motion.div
  initial={{ x: 100, opacity: 0 }}
  animate={{ x: 0, opacity: 1 }}
  exit={{ x: -100, opacity: 0 }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.3 }}
>
  {screenContent}
</motion.div>

// React Native Animated
Animated.timing(slideAnim, {
  toValue: 0,
  duration: 300,
  easing: Easing.ease,
}).start();
```
